# mctl

A tool to control both mpd/mpris music players.

`playerctl` can control mpris music players ( Also includes browsers ).  
`mpc` can control mpd music players.

This tool can control them both.

I wrote something similar in python a long time ago [xf86keys](https://github.com/uttarayan21/xf86keys).
